# ÔøΩÔ∏è Archipelago

An intelligent gamified learning platform that transforms educational content into engaging, interactive island-hopping adventures. Built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

## üìñ Project Description

Archipelago is a revolutionary educational platform that reimagines learning through the metaphor of exploring a chain of interconnected islands. Each concept becomes a unique island in a vast learning ocean, connected by bridges that unlock as students progress through their educational journey. The platform combines AI-powered content processing with immersive gamification elements to create an engaging and effective learning experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

#### üéØ State Management
The application uses React's Context API with useReducer for global state management:

```typescript
interface GameState {
  lectureData: LectureData | null;
  userProgress: UserProgress;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

**Key Actions:**
- `SET_LECTURE_DATA`: Loads processed educational content
- `COMPLETE_CONCEPT`: Updates progress when a concept is finished
- `UPDATE_PROGRESS`: Handles incremental progress updates

#### üóÇÔ∏è Type System
Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety and clear data contracts:

- **CoreConcept**: Individual learning units with quizzes and materials
- **UserProgress**: Tracks points, completed concepts, level, and achievements
- **LectureData**: Container for educational content with metadata
- **Quiz/Question**: Assessment system data structures

#### üé® Component Structure

**Core Components:**
- `LearningIslands`: Main visualization component rendering the island metaphor
- `FileUpload`: Drag-and-drop interface with react-dropzone integration
- `ConceptDetail`: Detailed view for individual concepts with explanations
- `QuizComponent`: Interactive assessment interface
- `ProgressDashboard`: Analytics and progress visualization

### üé≠ Animation & Visual Design

#### Framer Motion Integration
- **Island Animations**: Smooth entrance animations with spring physics
- **Bridge Connections**: Animated SVG paths with particle effects for completed connections
- **Micro-Interactions**: Hover effects, button animations, and state transitions

#### Advanced Visual Features
- **Dynamic Positioning Algorithm**: Islands positioned using percentage-based coordinates with rotation
- **Gradient Theming**: Difficulty-based color schemes using Tailwind CSS gradients
- **Backdrop Effects**: Multi-layered background with radial gradients and pattern overlays
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts that work across different screen sizes

### üéØ Learning Flow Engine

#### Sequential Progression Logic
```typescript
const isConceptLocked = (conceptIndex: number) => {
  if (conceptIndex === 0) return false;
  return !completedConcepts.includes(concepts[conceptIndex - 1].id);
};
```

#### Point & Level Calculation
- Points awarded per concept completion (100-150 points based on difficulty)
- Level calculation: `Math.floor(totalPoints / 100) + 1`
- Progressive difficulty scaling across the learning journey
